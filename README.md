# Haskel-Sat-solver

In the solver.hs file there is just a simple version of the SAT solver. To test it, compile the file and use the command "solve [] (VAR2)", without the quotation marks. 
In the backtracking.hs file the SAT solver has been enhanced with the backtracking function and a randomList function so that it can produce a number of different results at once.
To test it, compile the file and use the command "functionator 100 100 10", without the quotation marks, where the first number (100) represents the number of different formulas generated, the 
second number (100) represents the length of the formulas and the third number (10) represents the number of variables used in each formula.
